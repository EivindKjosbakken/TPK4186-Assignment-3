For experimental protocol: 150000 timeSteps, 1 robots, 500 truckloadWeight/5000 timesteps, 500 customerOrderWeight/5000 timesteps. Warehouse size: (16, 24). 120 different products: 
 
-avg time to complete truckload (that got completed): 31578.5 seconds, completed 20 truckloads, while 10 truckloads was received, but not finished. 
-Avg time to complete customerOrder (that got completed): 594764.2857142857 seconds, completed 21 customerOrders, while 129 customerOrders was received, but not completed
-Total weight of customerOrders: 14930, total weight of truckloads 14990
-During the simulation, the warehouse got full with stock, and could not load more products in, or complete a customerOrder. This means too much product came into the warehouse, or there was too few robots, or the warehouse had too few storage cells.
